# Lazy evaluation is a programming concept where an expression is only evaluated when its value is actually needed.
# This can improve the efficiency of programs by avoiding unnecessary computations.

# In the context of the program, "lazy evaluation" refers to the strategy where expressions are deferred until their results are explicitly requested or needed.
# Specifically, in the lazy evaluation section of the program,
# the generator function generate_values() is not immediately executed when creating the list comprehension [square(x) for x in generate_values()].
# Instead, the generator function is invoked only when iterating over its elements to compute the squared values,
# resulting in on-demand generation and processing of values, which conserves memory and computation resources.
